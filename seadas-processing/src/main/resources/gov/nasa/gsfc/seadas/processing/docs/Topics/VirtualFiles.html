<p>
    In the SeaDAS framework and within the SeaDAS documentation, regarding memory storage location, we can discuss files
    as being one of 3 types: System, Real or Virtual.

</p>
<p>A "system" file is a file whose data is stored directly on the file system of your computer.  Other names for this file
    might be "stored" file, or perhaps "physical" file.
</p>
<p>
    A "real" file, is a file existing within SeaDAS.  It occupies the temporary memory being used while SeaDAS is running.
    When you load a "system"
    file into SeaDAS, this essentially copies that file's data into a new memory (or RAM) location of your computer creating
    what we are calling a "real" file.  Any changes subsequently
    made within SeaDAS to the "real" file will not alter the stored "system" file unless you specifically save the file.
    Other names for a "real" file might be "loaded" file or "session" file.
</p>
<p>

    A "virtual" file is a file which has been generated within SeaDAS, but does not contain a complete
    set of its own data.  Instead it contains a mix of metadata, and associated operations set to be performed when they
    are needed.  The actual raster data needed to perform these operations exists in other file(s).  You can think of a
    virtual file as a small file (not actually stored on your computer) which is mathematically linked to other files.
    Tools which have an option to create either a virtual file or a saved file
    will run very fast when creating
    a virtual file, as compared with the time needed to create the saved file.
    This is because all the operations must be
    performed when creating the saved file, but not when creating the virtual file.

    An example of a virtual file would be if you run the Reproject Tool with the option "save the file" turned off.
    The output would be a virtual file which contains information about the reprojection operation which has not actually
    been performed yet.
    If you were to then open a band within the virtual file, at that point the reprojection
    operation would need to occur in order to display that band.

    If you "save" a virtual file, it's associated operations are run and it is transformed into a real file.
    A system file copy of this real file is made.

    Other names for a "virtual" file might be a "linked" file or perhaps a "logical" file.
</p>

<p>
    For instance, if the file on which you are
    doing statistics was created in the current SeaDAS session using the Reproject Tool but the resultant processed
    file was not saved,  then the band(s) on which you are doing statistics on have not actually been reprojected yet.
    Consequently, the statistics may run extremely slowly or computer memory issues may arise.

</p>

<p><i>

    Note: If you use a tool to create a virtual file from another virtual file, you are creating a chain of virtual files
    which gets increasing more difficult for SeaDAS and the computer memory to handle.  A chain of virtual files,
    depending on how long it is and the type of operations being performed, can bog the performance down to the point
    where the computer memory or some other issue just won't let the operation proceed.  In general
    it is advised to avoid generate a file using a virtual file as input, especially if that chains involves more than one
    intermediary virtual file along the chain.
</i>
</p>



Similarly, a virtual band is a band created within SeaDAS, but not converted to a "real" band.  This band may link to
other bands with associated operations set to be performed when it is needed.  Performing statistics on a virtual
band should be fine, possibly slower, but it all depends on the complexity of the virtual band's operations and
whether there is a chain of virtual bands.
